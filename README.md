TeamName - One More Byte

ProjectName - Ptarmigan

Project Description -

Ptarmigan will be a mobile app that will assist the user in making decisions on the stock market. It will do this by scraping tweets on Twitter and extracting pertinent information from them that will influence the stock markets. Users will be able to signup and login into Ptarmigan. The backend systems in Ptarmigan will pull information from tweets and use sentiment analysis to determine what the information that has been extracted from the tweet might mean for the stock market.

Ptarmigan’s mobile app will receive this processed data. The app will send push notifications to users to inform users of important information or events. Along with this primary feature, the user will be able to view stock market insights over specified time frames.

User’s will be able to subscribe to specific feeds to ensure that they only receive stock market information regarding industries that they are interested in. They will be able to make their own feeds using tags to determine what information those feeds should retrieve.

The application may also inform users on new public stocks or companies that the user may wish to keep an eye on. It may also allow users to share custom information and snapshots with other users. This will be done by either sending a link to a specific feed to another user or by sending the contents from an insight post to another user.

Ptarmigan will use a design that scales automatically when there is a need to do so. There will also be a separate application created specifically for admins and moderators to use. They will be able to make adjustments to the weighting of tweets if it is determined that insight that was determined was incorrect. Inaccurate insights can be flagged by users for moderation by moderators.
